# Central-Limit-Theorem
Central Limit theorem implimented by using simple python code.

Central Limit Theorem states that given a reasonable sample size (usually n >=30), the distribution of the means of the samples drawn from a population follows a normal distribution, even though the population may not necessarily follow the normaldistribution.

Assumptions in the Central Limit theorem are :-
1) Samples are drawn randomly from population.
2) Samples are independent form each other.
3) Sample size is sufficiently large.(Generally n= 30 suffice for symmetric population).
